  AnimalInformation: 'The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the
    genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant
    on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis,
    with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into
    up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear
    DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa
    are known from the fossil record. '

  AnimalInformation: 'Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living
    species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest
    elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the
    family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. The order was formerly much more
    diverse during the Pleistocene, but most species became extinct during the Late
    Pleistocene epoch. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis
    called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive
    skin.'

    Description: Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,
      and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs,
      forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water
      when it is accessible.
